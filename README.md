<h2>Classification Phishing Websites Dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/327/phishing+websites) using MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron).</h2>

<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
<p>In this repository we implemented a MLP Classifier to predict whether a website is a Phishing Website or not using The dataset mentioned above.</p>
<p>The model has ipmlemented via <b>SKLearn</b> library.</p>
<p>the MLP Classifier Model tested with different parameters specified in different sections.</p>
<p>Each section has different parameters and it's Accuracy in front</p>
<p>Due to the balanced dataset, the <b>Accuracy</b> metric was used to evaluate the model performance.</p>
